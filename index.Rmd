## Filtering Rows and Columns for SQL

[SWAG](https://echavi32.github.io/one/one)

With SQL you can filter Columns and Rows with WHERE. Let's look at an example using the Lahman baseball database. First, we need to load some packages. 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```

##A General Lay Out

Suppose we want to see the homerun totals for the 1927 Yankees. We could write the following:

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting 
WHERE teamID='NYA'  and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)
```

##Setting Limits and Data Layout

Suppose you want to find all instances where Yankees have hit 40 homeruns or more.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE HR>50"
sqldf(query)
```

##Setting Right and Left Limits To Data Set

Suppose we want to now find all examples where a player had more than 40 homeruns but less than 60 strikeouts.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR,SO FROM Batting
WHERE HR>40 and SO<50"
sqldf(query)
```

##Setting A Starting Limit, With Ordering By

Again, you want to find all instances of a player striking out less than 10 times. At least 400 at-bats (AB) players with least strikeouts at the top.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,SO,AB FROM Batting
WHERE AB>399 and SO<10"
sqldf(query)
```

##Ordering By, Different Scenario

One can also order output. To order the information, a ORDER BY clause is used. This will default to ascending order (smallest to largest). To organize in descending order, the DESC command will be placed after the ORDER BY command.

##Execution

Finding every instance of a player hitting more than 50 homeruns but lets have the players with the most homeruns at the top.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE HR>50
ORDER BY HR DESC"
sqldf(query)
```

Finding Babe-Ruth's career homerun totals.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID, sum(HR) FROM Batting
WHERE playerID='ruthba01'
GROUP BY playerID"
sqldf(query)
```

Finding the Career homerun totals of all players, but limit the display to only those that hit more than 600, and having the players with the highest total at the top.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID, sum(HR) FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING sum(HR)>600
ORDER BY sum(HR) DESC"
sqldf(query)
```

Finding the players with the highest homerun average over their career. Limit the display to those who have an average of more than 30. Players withe the highest average at the top.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID, avg(HR) FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID 
HAVING avg(HR)>30
ORDER BY avg(HR) DESC"
sqldf(query)
```

Finding all instances of players hitting more than 50 homeruns, give first, and last names teamID, yearID, and homeruns


```{r}
query<-"SELECT nameFirst, nameLast, yearID, teamID, HR
FROM Batting INNER JOIN Master
ON Batting.playerID=Master.playerID
WHERE HR>50"
sqldf(query)
```
List firstname, lastname, year, teamID, and HR limit to babe ruth.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT nameFirst, nameLast, yearID, teamID, HR 
FROM Batting INNER JOIN Master
ON Batting.playerID=Master.playerID
WHERE Batting.playerID='ruthba01'"
sqldf(query)
```

##Aggregation

Aggregation allows one to group and condense information in different ways, essentially 'squashing' different peces of data together. This is done by using the GROUP BY command. When using GROUP BY, one must then specify how the other columns asked for should be grouped. Should they be averaged, should they be added, or does one only want to see the minimum or maximum? These modifiers are placed on the other column names.This is how one would specify what should be done to those data sets:

*Summation: sum(colname)
*Average:avg(colname)
*Maximum: Max(colname)
*Minimum:min(colname)

If one wants to continue filtering after they have grouped, they can use the HAVING command, which functions as the filtering WHERE command when used after GROUP BY. ORDER BY can be used in the same way as before, coming at the end of the command list.

##Execution

Find the career homerun totals for Babe Ruth.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,sum(HR) FROM Batting 
WHERE playerID='ruthba01'
GROUP BY playerID"
sqldf(query)
```

##Joining

Joining allows tables to be joined together based on common data to increase the data output options. This is done through the INNER JOIN and ON commands. INNER JOIN indicates which tables are being joined together. ON indicates the common data that the tables will be joined by. If the common data appears alone in the code, it will need to either have specified which of the joined tables it is coming from, or replaced by the inforamtion from another table. In the first example, playerID in the SELECT phrase was replaced by nameFIRST and nameLAST to make reading the table easier.

##Execution

First and last name, along with team, year, and homeruns for Babe Ruth.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT nameFIRST,nameLAST,teamID,yearID,HR 
FROM Batting INNER JOIN Master
ON Batting.playerID=Master.playerID
WHERE Batting.playerID='ruthba01'"
sqldf(query)
```
